Listen up, sheeple, because I'm about to blow your minds with the most DEVASTATING corporate conspiracy hiding in plain sight at every McDonald's across this godforsaken planet. You think you know fast food? You think you understand the golden arches? THINK AGAIN.
The Filet-O-Fish – that seemingly innocent, battered rectangle of "fish" – is quite literally the MOST DIABOLICAL profit scheme ever conceived by the corporate overlords at McDonald's headquarters. While you're sitting there like a fool, thinking you're making a "healthier choice" by ordering fish instead of beef, Ronald McDonald himself is laughing maniacally as he counts the OBSCENE profits from your dietary decision.
Here are the FACTS that Big Mac doesn't want you to know:
The Filet-O-Fish is the SECOND cheapest item by manufacturing cost on the entire McDonald's menu. We're talking about PENNIES here, people. LITERAL PENNIES. Yet these corporate vampires have the AUDACITY to charge you 50 cents MORE than a hamburger – a hamburger made with comparably higher quality materials! Let that sink in for a moment. A HAMBURGER. WITH ACTUAL BEEF. Costs LESS than this fishy abomination.
But wait, it gets WORSE. So much worse.
That "premium" Filet-O-Fish you're paying $4.50 for? Let me break down the REAL cost:
The "fish" patty – and I use that term VERY loosely – is nothing more than an 80-gram slab of compressed, processed fish paste that McDonald's buys in MASSIVE industrial quantities for UNDER 10 CENTS per patty. TEN. CENTS. This isn't some fresh Atlantic cod caught by rugged fishermen at dawn – this is mechanically separated fish slurry pressed into a vaguely fish-shaped form and breaded with the cheapest coating known to mankind.
The tartare sauce? That glorified mayo-pickle mixture that they slather on with all the precision of a drunk toddler finger-painting? Maximum 3 cents when purchased in the apocalyptic bulk quantities that McDonald's operates with. THREE CENTS for that sad excuse for a condiment that probably contains more preservatives than actual food ingredients.
And don't even get me STARTED on that pathetic excuse for a bun – a piece of "bread" so processed, so artificially enhanced, so far removed from actual wheat that it probably glows in the dark. Less than 30 cents when bought in quantities that would make a Soviet grain distributor weep with envy.
Do the math, people! That's a MAXIMUM material cost of 43 cents for an item they're charging you $4.50 for! They're making over $4 in PURE PROFIT on every single Filet-O-Fish sold! That's a profit margin that would make cryptocurrency scammers and pharmaceutical executives blush with shame!
But the corporate conspiracy goes EVEN DEEPER. The Filet-O-Fish isn't just profitable – it's STRATEGICALLY profitable. While other menu items require skilled preparation, timing, and coordination, any minimum-wage employee can slap together a Filet-O-Fish in under 30 seconds. Drop the frozen fish brick in the fryer, squeeze some sauce from an industrial dispenser, slap it on a bun – BOOM. Four dollars and fifty cents, please.
They've created the PERFECT storm of maximum profit and minimum effort, all while convincing health-conscious consumers that they're making a "smart choice." It's psychological manipulation on a scale that would make Edward Bernays himself stand up and slow-clap.
Meanwhile, that "more expensive to produce" hamburger with its actual beef, more complex preparation process, and higher material costs? They're practically GIVING it away compared to this fishy profit machine.
The Filet-O-Fish isn't just a menu item – it's a MONUMENT to corporate greed, a testament to how thoroughly fast food companies have brainwashed the masses into paying premium prices for bottom-tier ingredients. Every time you order one, a McDonald's executive somewhere gets to add another gold-plated toilet to their yacht.
Wake up, America. Wake up, world. The Filet-O-Fish isn't food – it's a SCAM wrapped in breading and served with a side of corporate laughter. The next time you're tempted by that fishy rectangle of deception, remember this moment. Remember how they played you. Remember how they turned compressed fish paste into their most profitable con game.
The revolution starts with saying NO to the Filet-O-Fish industrial complex. Who's with me?
This message has been brought to you by someone who finally did the math and realized how badly we've all been played by Big Fish.
